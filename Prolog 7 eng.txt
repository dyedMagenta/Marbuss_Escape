The Great Horde did not receive a warm welcome from the dwarven forces. Still, with the help of the nagas, they were able to repulse enemy attacks and force their way to the central part of the caves. Snake women proved to be irreplaceable when there was a need to wade through the flooded underground passes or to look for an alternative way through the marshy grounds. Those women were mysterious, deadly, their every movement and their way of being was filled with something mistical, which fascinated some orcs and put fear in hearts of others.
Marbus himself had been spending less nad less time with his companions, instead he had gathered around himself a small group of advisors, greatest warriors and those, who familiarized themselves with the culture and philosophy of dwarves. Their task was to choose safe ways, to evade encouters with the much stronger enemy forces.
Gloom of this place was having a grim impact on the clan relations. Few serious fights took place, some orcs died. Culprits were quickly tracked and judged by the Great Souvereign, who adviced by Gewold, decided to benefit from the laws of war and hanged them. After that, nagas dragged the bodies into underground rivers, then covered them by rocks. Such death was the biggest possible dishonor for an orc and his family. Knowing the price of disloyality. the Horde didn't have any more internal struggles from then on.
In these grim days Aidala proved to be a real solace for Marbus. She was always ready to give him an advice or lend an ear when he just needed to talk. It was unacceptable for some of the advisors who still didn't trust the nagas and were affraid of their way of being. Hower, with the days passing, less and less people had an influence on the Great Souvereign's decisions, who in their eyes was becoming older and more rigorous every day. The journey through the undergrounds had such influence on most of the orcs.
Finally, the day has came in which the wanderers could feel the fresh breeze on their faces. They've reached an underground lake that was the last thing separating them from the caves' exit. However, everyone knew that in places like these dwarves very often set their settlements. Even without any proof of the danger ahead, Marbus ordered to prepare weapons.
