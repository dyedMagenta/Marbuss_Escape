Hej,
Tutaj masz dialogi poczƒÖtkowe. Przerobi≈Çem trochƒô scenariusz, zgodnie z Twoimi radami, ale nie do ko≈Ñca. Mo≈ºemy teraz sprawiƒá, ≈ºe krasnoludy pomogƒÖ nam w przekroczeniu jeziora, nie zaatakujƒÖ nas bƒÖd≈∫ bƒôdziemy z nimi walczyƒá. Jest na to kilka r√≥≈ºnych mo≈ºliwo≈õci dialogowych, dlatego mi tyle z tym zesz≈Ço. Pozosta≈Ço zrobiƒá dialogi, gdy zaatakuje nas nietoperz i potw√≥r wodny oraz gdy sko≈Ñczymy scenariusz.

1. PoczƒÖtek scenariusza

Aidala:
This Person feels the smell of the sun... The smell of the sun and of the grass... and warm waters, which run down to seas and oceans... Our way out is nearby.

Gewold:
Finally we will be able to leave these damned caves! We will light the fire, roast some animals and arrange a noisy feast!

Marbus:
I am afraid that the feast will have to wait. We are still on the dwarven grounds. We must be careful about what we do. Aidala, could you scout the lake for us? I would prefer not to walk into an ambush right before leaving this place.

*Tutaj Aidala wychodzi z naszego zamku i wkracza do wody, po czym wraca.*

Aidala:
These waters are evil... Death lurks in them. Death in the form of a beast. This Person advices not to venture into the deeps.

Kochan:
I must admit that although I was sceptic at first, now I see that these creatures proved to be invaluable. It would be really hard to pass these caverns without their help.

Marbus:
You are right, cousin. We are in your debt, Aidala. In yours, and your daughtersí. As for the lake, do not enter the waters unless you have no other choice. We will bypass it and then be on our way out of the caves!

2. Spotkanie krasnolud√≥w.

Zobaczony krasnolud:
In the name of... Orcs! A whole army of orcs! Send word to the commander!

Gewold:
There goes our avoiding of a battle. It is good though, they must have a lot of meat for our feast. Not mentioning the beer.

Kochan:
Do not make haste opinion... Remember that the Northern Alliance recruits orcs into their army. We can pass off them, to get to the other side of the caves.

Przyw√≥dca krasnolud√≥w:
Whose feet make such noise under the doorsteps of my fortress? What are you looking for in the undergrounds, orcs?

Marbus:
Option 1: Peace upon you! We are members of the Northern Alliance. We need to get to the other side of the mountains. Can you help us?
Option 2: The name is Marbus. I am the Great Souvereign of my people and I will pass through this underground.

Wybranie opcji 2:

Przyw√≥dca krasnolud√≥w:
So the Horde has gathered again? I may have few soldiers but mark my words - your journey ends here! Come, brothers! Make this corridors flood with the blood of orcish dogs!

Wybranie opcji 1:

Przyw√≥dca krasnolud√≥w:
Peace on you! Yet I must be assured that you are telling the truth... Usually the Northern Alliance would send a human emissary with orcs, so there is no doubt about their allignment. Where is your emissary?

Marbus:
Opcja 1a: Enough of this mascarade! To arms, my orcs!
Opcja 2a: Unfortunately our emissary perished during our mission.
Opcja 3a: Aidala is our emissary.
Opcja 4a: Krull the Rock is our emissary.
Opcja 5a: Emborgi-tarash is our emissary.
Opcja 6a: Barley is our emissary, it is a magical wolf.
*opcja 4a i 5a nie mogƒÖ byƒá razem*

Opcja 1a:

Krasnolud przyw√≥dca:
Imposture! To arms, my brothers! May the orcish blood flow.

Opcja 3a:

Aidala:
This Person will speak in the name of glorious Northern Alliance! We salut you, noble dwarves, and ask for your assisstance in crossing this way...

Przy. krasnolud√≥w:
You are a... naga. Wicked weird is the fact that you were chosen as the emissary... But it is been a damn long time since you were fighting along the Horde. What happened that made you join the Northern Alliance?

Aidala:
My race finally understood the mistakes of the past... To redeam ourselves we've chosen the path of the righteousness. For a time now we have been a lawful nation, like the orcs. Our races cooperated for many years. The Alliance wanted to renew the old Horde tactics and learn our common culture, so it merged our ranks together. Your brethen assisted us on our way here. What will you do?

Krasnolud:
Praise the Northern Alliance! I will help you! Walking out of here will not be easy thou, because of the damn monsters hiding in the deep. Not to mention the giant bats and other beasts. Yet, we should be able to have some fun sharpening our blades on their backs. We will show you the way.

Marbus:
My thoughts are the same, my friend. Aidala... Thank you. Again.


Opcja 4a:

Krull Ska≈Ça:
Me is the giant emissary! Me be diplomat! You listen to trolls!

Krasnolud:
Trolls are our biggest enemies in these caves! I refuse to believe someone like that could be chosen to be an emissary of the Northern Alliance!

Krull Ska≈Ça:
Stupid midget! He will believe, when we open his head!

Krasnolud przyw√≥dca:
Imposture! To arms, my brothers! May the orcish blood flow.

Opcja 5a:

Jaszczurka:
Hail, dwarves! I bow before the greatness and longevity of your people. I am glad to be able to see the greatness of your cities, corridors and mines again.

Krasnolud:
Then I am also glad to see you. Orcs, lizards, nagas... Together, you look almost like the Great Horde is assembled again.

Jaszczurka:
Because it is indeed... The Horde understood it's mistakes... In the face of the danger that emerged from the north we are all equal, my child... There is no wisdom in fighting anymore with each other. Let us pass.

Krasnolud:
I... I don't have enough warriors to stop you anyway... I have no idea how did you manage to find your way here... So be it. You may pass, but mark my words - If you attack us or even get close to my fortress, we will fight.

Jaszczurka:
I am glad that despite of our differences we are still able to find a common tongue inside of our hearts. It is an important lesson for our peoples.

*Tutaj krasnoludy zamierajƒÖ i nie mogƒÖ siƒô ruszaƒá bƒÖd≈∫ rekrutowaƒá. Je≈õli wejdziemy do ich twierdzy bƒÖd≈∫ zaatakujemy kt√≥rego≈õ, w√≥wczas zacznƒÖ z nami walki i wy≈õwietli siƒô poni≈ºszy dialog.*

Imposture! To arms, my brothers! May the orcish blood flow.

Opcja 6a:

Krasnolud:
Magical wolf? Let us see...

*Z zamku krasnolud√≥w wybiega krasnolud runmistrz na 3 poziomie. Podchodzi do Jƒôczmienia. Je≈õli wilk pogryz≈Ç amulet Marbusa, wy≈õwietli siƒô dialog 6b, je≈õli nie pogryz≈Ç- 6c.*

Opcja 6b:

Runmistrz:
I find this wolf to be very magical. We should let them pass.

Krasnolud przyw√≥dca:
If my own Runemaster says so, there is no need to argue!

Krasnolud:
Praised be the Northern Alliance! I will help you. Walking out of here will not be so easy, because of monsters of the deep, dwelling in this lake. Not to mention the giant bats and other beasts. However, together we will definitely manage it.

Marbus:
Barley... you are a good puppy.

Jƒôczmie≈Ñ:
Warf, warf!


Opcja 6c:

Runmistrz:
I find that there is no magic in this animal! It was all a plot to lure me out and kill me! Help me brothers!

Krasnolud przyw√≥dca:
Imposture! To arms, my brothers! May the orcish blood flow.

Opcja 2a:

Krasnolud:
Pretty handy excuse... However, if you say you were traveling with the emissary, you must know which clan this grounds belong to. Now I will ask you few questions. Let us see if you really are from the Northern Alliance!
