The next one like that is placed a couple of days of march to the north. You have cut our way to Gelu'Aben!"}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Calm down, cousin. I can not see any evidence of pillage. The food is still in the granaries. Not to mention the treasures. I doubt the reptiles have raided the homes of our brothers."}

We had good relationship with orcs from the settlement. Soon, trade between us started to flourish. We gave them medications, they gave us metals... Everything changed a month ago."}   
 		{MESSAGE Ashuran () () _"It was a cold an foggy night, like during all the winters. Our shamanesses had been foreseeing coming of evil forces for a long time. Yet, what we saw was unspeakable... Ghosts got out of forests almost noiselessly. They had managed to murder a dozen of our warriors before the orcs realised they were being attacked. Chaos blew up. Together with my best warriors I rushed up the river to help your brothers, but when we reached the bridge..."}
 		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Continue, saurian leader"}
 		{MESSAGE Ashuran () () _"One of the ghosts possessed the body of the orcish leader. He grabbed olive oil and torches. I saw him pour and emblaze the oil on himself with maniacal laughter... The bridge burned shortly after him... We couldn't see much through the smoke. The of the dying could be heard until morning. A few of my veterans tried to swim across the river... None has returned."}
 		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Cousin, I've got a feeling the saurian is saying truth. A few of my scouts found tracks of their medications. We can not let a pointless battle happen."}
 		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Yes, you are right, Kochan. Saurian! Me and my warriors want to cross the river!"}
 		{MESSAGE Ashuran () () _"I fear it will be utterly hard, orc... Our oracle sensed evil coming from the south. Maybe we will manage to counter the undead together, though."}
 		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"So be it. Those soulless creatures will pay a big price for killing our brothers. Let the women and children take all the food from the granaries while we kill the undead off."}
