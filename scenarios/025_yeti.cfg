             story = _"And, as in almost every story, when our protagonists are almost completely wrecked, the fate sends them hope and rest. Their balm turned out to be Tut'anor. So far it had not been very hospitable to them. Yet, nobody felt neither bad energy nor thrills this time. Totally as if someone sucked all the evil from this place and made this pas perfectly average looking like a thousand of others."
