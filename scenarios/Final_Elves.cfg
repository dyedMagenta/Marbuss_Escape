Only a few surviving detachments and groups of deserters were left. The North was shattered, and Beatrice was trying to take care of it.

Last bastions of Northern Alliance, Elvish Jarls and Knalga were falling one by one... With the end of the King of Gon, warming came and the world began to thaw, which only sped the process. Orcs murdered, pillaged, conquered... They went frenzy and seemed even more powerfull and fearfull. Soon, the whole North was sinking in its own blood."

		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Dwarves? And here I thought that we exterminated all pests underground. It's good they showed themselves on the surface. We'll feast our eyes on those dwarfs until we finally finish off this race and make them our slaves. And you, Jarl... You're old, embittered, and full of hatred. It's time to end your life."}
		{MESSAGE Ughirt () () _"I remember more battles than years you lived. I surpass you in tactical genius, experience, knowledge... You won't be able to overcome my soldiers."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"We will, because we surpass you in numbers, bloodlust, and equipment. You don't even know how many weapons we've got... We keep most of it in storages, because even the Great Horde can't use all of it. And you? It's probably rather hard to get any metal in this forest. How do you fight? You share one sword for three wariors?"}
		{MESSAGE Ughirt () () _"Even if we lack equipment, we still have the spirit! Elves, dwarves! Let's pay them back for everything they did to us!"}
		{MESSAGE Gilfit () () _"For Snowfeet!"}
