  			story=_"The recent danger, the mighty undead, feared by children and women, in front of whom orcs had been falling. Has been defeated. Even though it happened neither without doubts, nor without sacrifice, in the beating hearts of orcs the warfare and the lust of survival have inflamed. The warriors saw that even the most dreadful demons may be defeated."

  			story=_"They managed to do it only thanks to the help of Saurians. When years ago, sovereign Gewold refused them help and shelter, everyone was expecting the war. In the far north the great battle between the orcish clans and Saurians was supposed to fire. Two kinds of blood would flood the dry hills and the swampy marches. However, this battle never happened."

  			story=_"It even turned out that these two races could live in harmony. In face of much more serious danger they were able to forget separating them differences and stood together the combat, which would they certainly lose divided."

  			story=_"Solted in battles and disciplined Saurian units joined Marbus' forces. They were commanded by an old Saurian Oracle, Emborgi'tarash. Mysterious and taciturn, with a nearly blind gaze. She was predicting and auguring. Marbus didn't know many people whom he respected, but she has been counted in them as soon as she appeared."

  			story=_"After a two-days march, Marbus' army reached the place where they were to face way less terrifying opponent. It was a school of magi in the north. Always full warehouses, rich treasuries, good food... Orcs were in their power once again. That's how they thought about the battles - beat the enemy and leave their body to be devoured by wolves. Take everything they had. Drink, eat and sleep. Live with what has been robbed. Until the gold runs out. Then sharpen the sword. Orcs had no tombs. They did not visit their dead. They knew their bodies would be thrown for dogs after death. But what if your enemy is an undead torturer? Who neither bleeds nor greeds your treasure? What does it want, then?... Your soul?"

		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"I don't fear a confrontation with lizards. There are too few of them to threaten us. Also, there is no reason not to trust them. Now silence, their leader is coming."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Lord of orcs, we have arrived to our homeland. I can smell a human-scum odour. Odour of their coloured clothes, their elixirs, their magic! They must be driven away!"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"We will keep our promise, shaman. But please tell me, what help shall I expect from you?"}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"You will be able to recruit our best fighters and shamans. They are fast and dexterous, so they will easily kill anyone who comes to swamp."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Also, on these cursed humans' territories, there are some settlements of our brothers left. Throughout them, you'll find good old warriors. They would be an indescribable help in this battle, and even decide its result."}

		{MESSAGE Umberg () () _"As I thought... Every orc should die from a sword and every lizard should crawl under our feet. Call our adepts and soldiers, kill them all! When they start running away, we'll prepare sledges and chase them."}

		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Humans' pride has no borders. These people always were filled with it. Pride and arrogance poured into them when Haldric I touched the Ruby of Fire the first time. Then he allocated his people for the eternal hunger. Hunger of power, knowledge and authority. It is a strong hunger, which none shall extinguish."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Hum? How can you know such things?"}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Tribes pass away, kings replace kings. Yet we stay and remember. And we get our knowledge across. Although my eyes turned pale many years ago, I still remember our mighty city of Saurgath..."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"I don't mean to break your conversation, but the battle is coming. Your knowledge is amazing, but how about your arms? Are they worth anything?"}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Sssonsss! To armsss! Show them the power sleeping in our boiling blood! Let's reclaim our homeland!"}
