 			story = _"The forces of dwarves and Northern Alliance have been vanquished, and Marbus's clan joined forces with residents of Gelu'Aben. Soon after that, they managed to dress their wounds, say goodbye to the dead and feed the hungry. The orcish elders decided to take out the last supplies out of the granaries and a great feast was held, with Marbus as the guest of honour. Everybody's happiness lasted the whole day. The one day  when they managed to forget about the winter, the hordes of undead and about the Northern Alliance running rampant."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"One day after the feast, there was a meeting arranged council was called, which's reason whose aim was to solve all the problems which afflicted the orcish clans. Everybody, with whom the elders were still in touch with, came along. A proud and once great nation of orcs wasn't even able to fill half of the city. On the streets, women, oldsters and emaciated children were wandering around. Only here and there you could find a man with weapon, or a goblin whittling arrows for another battle. Gelu'Aben was becoming a grave."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
 			story = _"At the council, twelve people came along: clans' representatives and the elders. Everybody tried to enforce their standpoint, and all of them were based on one clear concept: to stay in the fortress and wait everything out. Only Marbus thought that by doing so way they wouldn’t survive. After slamming his hand on the table and putting orcs in order, he managed to convince them that all that awaits them here is death. Gewold was the first person to oppose Marbus – an escape isn't an option, because where would they escape into? are they supposed to go?"
 		[/part]
 		[part]
			story = _"And then the elders spoke up – there was an abandoned fortress in the east, over the mountains. It was situated in the mysterious Kalindor Fields. There are supposed to be Ancient orcish writings containing knowledge on how to survive such an apocalypse  were to be found over there. which contain knowledge about how to survive such apocalypse. The whole plan seemed to be based on tales and myths, but in the current situation, no one could come up with a better solution. Moreover, no one could figure out how to get through the mountains."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
			story = _"Marbus, who had already decided to get in the Kalindor Fields, suggested to leading the orcs through the dwarven tunnels. Although Gelu'Aben was within a stone's throw from them, no orc has crossed the entrance to dwarven caverns for years. A once warlike race started to fear the power which Knalga had become."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
			story = _"A voting was taken to decide about the future of all the clans. Seven out of twelve voters agreed to go through the tunnels. The same seven has also agreed that Marbus would become the new Great Sovereign. Gewold sat in silence, he was against to both these decisions."
 		[/part]
 		[part]
			story = _"The next morning, the Great United Horde grabbed their torches and set the city on fire. After just an hour, a once great Gelu'Aben became a ruin. There was no turning back; only the elves in the forests and the soldiers of the Northern Alliance watched suffocating those who would approach the fortress. Meanwhile, Marbus took the Great Sovereign’s banner and was the first to descended beneath the ground, leading his brothers into the darkness of the dwarven tunnels."

		{MESSAGE narrator (wesnoth-icon.png) () _"At last, Marbus's horde strided into the dark and dump dwarven corridors. Last of the orcs: the oldsters and women who dragged little carts with belongings and food, as well as a small livestock, such as goats and chickens, left the pale light of dawn behind. Now, their path would only be lit by torches and phosphorescing fungi, which grew here and there, giving off a nasty, acrid smell. That's how their journey through the deeps began."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Yuck! These mushrooms stink so terribly that even our wargs start to yelp. I start to doubt in the point of our journey, Marbus. We have  already been walking for a few hours, and the tunnels are becoming narrower and narrower."}
		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Shrooms stink and hurt. Hurt in belly. I eaten too much and now vomit."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"This type of mushrooms shouldn't stink... It looks like even here, beneath the ground, the nature starts to feel the consequences of what is happening on the surface. So, take a good look, orcish warriors! This is the best evidence of how strong the ghost who runs rampant on these lands is."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Calm down, Gewold, or I will deem that you are becoming crusty due to the old age. There is no way back for us – we must move forward."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"I must admit, however, that I feel uneasy as well, cousin. And it's not just about the tunnels, but about the lack of any signs of dwarves. I believed that we would force our way to the other side over their corpses, having a precisely marked out path. If we get lost here, then neither starts, nor winds, nor wolves... Nothing will show us the way."}
		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Trolls been living here for years and ages. I and my sons know how to walk in darkness in order to find the way. When you get lost, we will lead."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Can it be that my blind eyes see more than yours? Seeing? Know that my folks aren’t afraid of the darkness of this place. We will find a way, even if we would have to call our ancestors for help! And the ancestors of ours ancestors! And the ancestors of our ancestors' ancestors as well!"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"You see, then? We have nothing to be afraid of. Since when those undead appeared in the north, I feel like if an mysterious force leadead us by the hand. Although it might be an old orcsess' superstition, I believe in the destiny. And dying in this place isn't our destiny."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Silence! Calm down these wargs right now! Can you hear that? It's the burble of a river."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Thank our forefathers! We will replenish our canteens and drink to our's fill, provided the waters is drinkable. It's also possible that we will find a dwarven settlement by the river, so have yours swords ready."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Onwards, my warriors! Move deftly and quietly! Don't split up though, however – we don't know what dangers will await us in these tunnels."}

		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"Your companion's remark was spot-on, son of the north. The majority of my race would turned their backs on our tradition and the elders' beliefs. This Person, however, never got rid of her pride, never quenched the sorrow and hatred that stir in her heart... And yet... This Person couldn't fight."}

		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"Less than one century ago, the elders of my kin called the Great Council on which we were supposed to debate how to save Her race from the calamity... But at the council, we faced a betrayal. Young nagas, living in the most shallow waters, decided to join forces with the Nortern Alliance and murdered the vast majority of Her race. This Person fought fiercely, killing many of her daughters and sisters, but This Person couldn't save the elders."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"I got sealed off with my most trusted daughters... The road to the sea was closed. And on land, crossbowmen were waiting for us. This Person could have died a grand and just death... However, it would result in that there wouldn't be any ceasing the hatred between nagas and Northern Alliance anymore. Dwarves, elves and even The Great Kingdom of Wesnoth... Everyone would start identifying Her race with something good. With something that got rid of its darkness and joined them to hunt pearls, help sailors and swim with dolphins."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"This Person couldn't stand that! This Person had to live in order to hate. To bear witness to the darkness and decay, The Witness of the Snake. This Person had gathered its daughters and set off in the only dirrection where This Person could survive - to the caves. So here, in the darkness and gloom we've started to spawn, to grow stronger and wait for the moment when we could inflict the deadly blow to our enemies. This Person presumes this moment has come now."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Your story is full of passion and darkness, my lady... The enemy that is pursuing us is yet even darker. I will welcome You and Your daughters in my ranks with joy."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"You should reconsider this... Not everyone who doesn’t want to attack is is our friend. They may betray us when the first opportunity occurs, joining that nagas that are on the Northern Alliance side already."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"Sss... Silence, orc... Stay silent or I will make you silent forever... If it is needed, This Person will make an oath. This Person swears on the stars and snakes, on the poison and swords, on the blood of black and red, that This Person will serve your Great Sovereign and will give the whole of Herself to him!"}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"Even in the face of the latest events I must admit, my cousin, that it sounds pretty decent."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"I am glad that your humour is back, Kochan. As for the nagas... So be it. From now on you are my people as well. Together we must work our way out of this tunnels."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"My hearth is full of joy knowing that we will be fighting together with the water snakes. There are no other creatures on this continent that are more stubborn, full of passion and hate born, and that didn’t leave this world into the cold hands of the death."}
		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Trolls likes snakes. Let there is friendship between us."}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"My Chieftain... Let me give you an a piece of advice... The underground midgets were also influenced by the Evil Spirit that devastates this lands. They are weak... Together, we can face them and defeat them. But there is another way. Their guards are few and far between, their numbers are scarce in most of the corridors. We can reach east unnoticed if we will move carefully."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"That's a good advice. Personally I would rather not participate in the fight - the terrain is not suitable for that."}
		{MESSAGE Gewold () () _"Quit babbling, Kochan! We need gold and supplies and there should be plenty of it in their fortifications! If we do not kill them now, they will emerge from the caves and attack us in the least expected moment when you least expect it. To avoid open war, we must attack first!"}
		{MESSAGE Aidala () () _"My chieftain, this is not all. This Person knows more... In the north, in the tunnels abbandoned by the midgets... I can feel magic vibrations emanating from there... This Person and her daughters think something can be hidden there, something that might prove useful in the future. It can even have the decisive effect in the final encounter."}
		{MESSAGE Krull () () _"Treasure! Trolls want that treasure! We not forgot that trolls were good, when trolls had treasure!"}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"I also feel something magical... There is some mighty arcane power... But different, not dwarven. I think it may have something to do with the evil that engulfs the north. We should aquire this thing."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Thank you all for your advices. Aidala... Whatever I decide, I want you to be at my side. I am really glad that we've met. And now – onwards!"}
