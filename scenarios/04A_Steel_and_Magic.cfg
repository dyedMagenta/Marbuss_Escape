  		[part]
  			story=_"A recent danger, the mighty undead, feared by children and women, in front of whom orcs had been falling ... has been defeated. Even though it happened neither without doubts, nor without sacrifice, in the beating hearts of orcs the warfare and the lust for survival have inflamed. The warriors saw that even the most dreadful demons could be defeated."

  		[/part]
  		[part]
  			story=_"They managed to do it only thanks to the help of Saurians. When years ago sovereign Gewold refused them to help and shelter them, everyone was expecting the war. In the far north the great battle between the orcish clans and Saurians was supposed to break out. Two kinds of blood would flood the dry hills and the swampy marches. However, this battle never happened."
 			background="story/swamp-03.jpg"
  		[/part]
  		[part]
  			story=_"Yet it even turned out that these two races could live in harmony. In face of much more serious danger they were able to forget separating them their differences and stood together into combat, which would they certainly lose if acted separately."
  			background="story/swamp-03.jpg"
  		[/part]
  		[part]
  			story=_"Saurian units, solted in battles and disciplined, joined Marbus's forces. They were commanded by an old Saurian Oracle, Emborgi-tarash - mysterious and taciturn, with a nearly blind gaze. She was foreseeing and auguring. Marbus didn't know many people whom he respected, but was counted in them as soon as she appeared."
 			background="story/swamp-03.jpg"
  		[/part]
  		[part]
  			story=_"After a two-days march, Marbus's army reached the place where they were to face way a less terrifying opponent. It was a school of magi in the north. Always full warehouses, rich treasuries, good food... Orcs were in their power once again. That's what they thought about the battles - beat the enemy and leave their body to be devoured by wolves. Take everything they had. Drink, eat and sleep. Live off with what has been robbed. Until the gold runs out. Then sharpen the sword. Orcs had no tombs. They did not visit their dead. They knew that at their death, their bodies would be thrown to dogs. But what if your enemy is an undead torturer? Who neither bleeds nor desires your treasure? What does it want, then?... Your soul?"

		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"I don't fear the confrontation with lizards. There are too few of them to threaten us. Also, there is no reason not to trust them. Now silence, their leader is coming."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Lord of orcs, we have arrived in our homeland. I can smell the odour of the human-scum. The odour of their coloured clothes, their elixirs, their magic! They must be driven away!"}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"We will keep our promise, shamaness. But please, tell me, what help shall I expect from you?"}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"You will be able to recruit our best fighters and shamen. They are fast and dexterous, so they will easily kill anyone who sets their feet at the swamp."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Apart from that, on these cursed humans' territories, there are some settlements of our brothers left. Among them, you'll find good old warriors. They would be an invaluable help in this battle, even determinig the outcome of the battle."}

		{MESSAGE Tambaros () () _"These are orcs, Master. I can also see some Saurians among them. Probably, they hope to regain these lands. They seem freezing cold and exhausted though, they'll not put up resistance for long."}
		{MESSAGE Umberg () () _"As I thought... Every orc should die by the sword and every lizard should crawl under our feet. Call our adepts and soldiers, kill them all! When they start running away, we'll prepare sledges and start chasing them."}
		{MESSAGE Tambaros () () _"Like after aurochs? Unfortunately, these animals won't provide us with such expensive trophies...Oh well, at least our adepts will practise their spells."}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Humans' pride has never had any boundaries. These people were always filled with it. Pride and arrogance poured into them when Haldric I touched the Ruby of Fire for the first time. Then he wrote his people off for the eternal craving. The craving for power, knowledge and authority. It is a strong craving, which none shall defy."}
		{MESSAGE Marbus () () _"Hum? How can you know such things?"}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Tribes pass away, kings replace kings. Yet we live and remember. And we get our knowledge across. Although my eyes turned pale many years ago, I still remember our mighty city of Saurgath..."}
		{MESSAGE Kochan () () _"I don't mean to break your conversation, but the battle is coming. Your knowledge is amazing, but how about your arms? Are they worth anything?"}
		{MESSAGE Emborgi () () _"Sssonsss! To armsss! Show them the power slumbering in our boiling blood! Let's reclaim our homeland!"}
